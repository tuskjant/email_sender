    <h3  style="font-size: 14px;">How to use</h3>
    <ol>
        <li style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>Recipients: </strong>You can manually enter recipient data for up to one recipient. Alternatively, you can use a CSV file
        where each row represents a recipient, with the format: "name, name@email.com". Choose the email basis: sending
        to all recipients every time or one recipient at a time. Messages will be sent to recipients by order in one-at-a-time mode. </li>
        <li style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>Messages: </strong>You can either write up to one message directly or select one or more TXT files to be used as
            messages. In a TXT file, the first line will be considered the subject of the email. Whenever the characters
            <b>[NAME]</b> are found in the text, they will be replaced with the recipient's name. Select the messages' basis:
            sending all messages every time or one message at a time. In one-at-a-time mode, messages will be sent by order.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>Schedule. </strong>Sending dates will be obtained from start to end sending dates using the selected frequency
            (once, daily, weekly, monthly or yearly) All emails will be sent within 30 minutes around selected time.</li>
        <li style="font-size: 10px;"><strong>Task </strong>will be shown for revision. To program the task click on
            <img src="images/correo-electronico_prog.png" alt="program task" width="24" height="24"> sending icon. Program will run on silent mode
            and emails will be sent on selected dates.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p style="font-size: 10px;">Click on <img src="images/correo-electronico_lista.png" alt="tasks list icon" width="24" height="24"> to consult
        and review pending tasks. Select one task and click on the <img src="images/error.png" alt="delete icon" width="24" height="24">
